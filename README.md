"Greta" is a chatbot built using Python and is a command line application.

PDF files including information about climate change legislations and net zero targets have been loaded onto Pinecone.

GPT-3.5 is the LLM used for this project.

Using an OpenAI API key, the chatbot can give you answers to your questions if it finds it in the data provided by the PDFs.
